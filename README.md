** OBS: I've found problemns creating a virtual enviroment on mac so it can be helpfull to someone

```While creating a virutal enviroment on mac use the comands``
```python -m venv "name of virtual enviroment"``
```cd "directory of virtual enviroment"```
```source bin/activate```

This will change the actual python enviroment to the virtual enviroment created previously
